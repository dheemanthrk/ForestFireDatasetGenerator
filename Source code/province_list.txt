The cleaned list of provinces/territories is now ready for integration into your UI or script for further processing. Here's how you can use this list effectively:

### **Final Clean List for Integration:**
- Alberta
- British Columbia
- Manitoba
- New Brunswick
- Newfoundland and Labrador
- Northwest Territories
- Nova Scotia
- Nunavut
- Ontario
- Prince Edward Island
- Quebec
- Saskatchewan
- Yukon

### **Next Steps for Province Selection:**
1. **Integration with Dropdown (UI):**
   Pass this cleaned list as options for a dropdown in your UI so users can select their desired province.

2. **Filter the Shapefile Based on Selection:**
   When the user selects a province from the dropdown, use the selection to filter the shapefile. This ensures that only the relevant province's boundaries are extracted.

3. **Save Filtered Shapefile for Future Use:**
   Save the filtered province shapefile to a specific folder (e.g., `/filtered_shapefiles`) for downstream tasks like grid creation, climate data merging, etc.
